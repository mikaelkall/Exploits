# active_directory attacks

Here I will store my active directory attacking tools.

Attack that Tim Medin presented at DerbyCon 2014 where he released a tool he called Kerberoast which cracks Kerberos TGS tickets, He determined that possession of a TGS service ticket encrypted
with RC4 provides the opportunity to take the ticket to a password cracking computer (or cloud system)
and attempt to crack the service account’s password. How does this work? Since the TGS Kerberos ticket is
encrypted with RC4 encryption, that means the service account’s password hash is used to encrypt the ticket.
The cracking system only needs to have a dictionary list of words and common passwords which the cracking system
loops through, converts to NTLM, and attempts to open the TGS ticket. If the TGS ticket is opened, we know
the clear text password and the NTLM password hash for the account.

## Notes

This PoC will later be extended with support for silver ticket and golden ticket attacks for complete AD compromise

The extented PoC is focused to be run from Linux as most of the tutorial and examples out there is done from windows and I want
to diffentiate myself and have a working linux solution to trigger all these attacks.
