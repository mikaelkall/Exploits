# log4jrce

Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 through 2.15.0 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0, this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects. 
## Summary

Log4j Remote Code execution proof of concept code for pop shell.

This version is a rewrote of the ldaprefserver from Jolokia exploit as I did not want to depend on the JNDIexploit jar file.
Note this version do not stage any payload on server first for create the reverse shell.
