# log4jrce

Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 through 2.15.0 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0, this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects. 
## Summary

Log4j Remote Code execution proof of concept code for pop shell.

## Disclaimer

Wanted to build my own ldap refserver with the template I used from the Jolokia exploit
but as a better refserver was already out there and wanted a working PoC quick as all the fuzz around this
I just piggybacked on their work so no skills required for build this see reference to the bitbucket
repositories used for the ldap refserver under JNDIExploit.
