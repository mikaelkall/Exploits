# Java RMI Registry Exploit

## Summary 

Java RMI is the Java version of Distributed object communication and is mainly used to implement
client-/server applications like Java based Fat-Clients. Like most implementations, Java is using stubs and
skeletons to do this. To create those stubs and skeleteons, Java requires that the service must define an
interface which extends the Remote interface.                                                                
                                                                                                             
To make this implementation accessible over the network, the server must register a service instance under
a name in a RMI Naming Registry. You can compare the registry to a phone book or DNS server.
The service instance gets registered under a certain name.
Clients can query the register to get a reference for the serve-side object and which interfaces its
implements. Most RMI naming registries use the default port (TCP 1099) for the naming registry but an
arbitrary port can be used. This abuse a deserialization issue to execute code in this implementation.
