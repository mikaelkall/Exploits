# CVE-2017-5941

An issue was discovered in the node-serialize package 0.0.4 for Node.js. Untrusted data passed into the unserialize() function can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by passing a JavaScript Object with an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). 

## Disclaimer

This is not my finding I just package this CVE as its good to document it, to have it documented if testing similar stuff.
